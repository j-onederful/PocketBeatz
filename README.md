 Planning on using
 - Next.js
 - Typescript
 - CSS (Tailwind)
 - Possibly Web Audio API
 - Possibly MongoDB (for stretch)

 ### UserFlow
 ---
 Once user navigates to page they will immediately be able to start making their very own beats with the click of their mouse or tap of their finger. In addition to the 12 beat pad buttons, there will be seperate buttons which enable to change beat library that produces different percussive sounds. Pop-up instructions modal will display when clicked on.

 ### MVP
 ---
 * Create a grid screen with twelve clickable boxes
 * Boxes make certain percussive noise when clicked on (or tapped on mobile device)
 * Render instructions button
 * Buttons to switch sound libraries
 * Use Tailwind to create a very nice looking beatpad
 * Use mediaquery to make app extremely accesible via phone


 ### Stretch Goals
 ---
 * Link certain keys on keyboard so that user doesn't have to click to make beats
 * Include background animations for when certain buttons are pressed 
 * Ability to record beat and play it back
 * Development of fullstack MERN app so user can save beat they created
  - Create login and sign up pages, as well as saved beats pages
 * Ability to edit saved beats
 
 
 ### Sprints
 ---
 1. Day 1:
   * Research research research. Familiarize myself with NEXT.js and all other unfamiliar technologies
 2. Day 2:
   * Set up rough front end so am able to work on functionality and be able to test
 3. Day 3:
   * Work on getting functionality good to go with sounds and libraries linked up correctly
 4. Day 4:
   * Get CSS looking slick and make sure mobile accessible
 5. Day 5:
   * Stretch goals (link keys to pads for computer accessibility, enable recording and playback of beats)
 6. Day 6:
   * Stretch (begin implementing MERN, login first and sign up first)
